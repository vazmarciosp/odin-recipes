# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course.  
It is a small recipe website built with basic HTML to practice structuring content and linking multiple pages together.

## What this project shows

- Creating a simple multi‑page website using only HTML.
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images to organize content.
- Creating and using relative links between pages.
- Structuring files and folders in a clear, logical way.
- Using Git and GitHub to track changes and share the project.

When this project is finished, it will demonstrate my ability to build a basic website from scratch, follow a project specification, and manage the code using version control.
