            <li>500 g black beans, soaked overnight</li>
            <li>300 g pork shoulder, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>200 g smoked sausage, sliced</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>In a large pot, fry the bacon until it releases some fat, then add the sausage and pork shoulder and brown them on all sides.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot and cook until they soften and become fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the drained beans, add the bay leaves, and pour in enough water to cover everything by a few centimeters.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the feijoada simmer gently for 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed.</li>
                <li>When the beans are tender and the broth is thick, season with salt and black pepper to taste and simmer for a few more minutes.</li>
