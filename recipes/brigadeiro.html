    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a classic Brazilian chocolate truffle made from condensed milk, 
        cocoa powder, and butter, slowly cooked until thick and then rolled into 
        bite-sized balls.</p>
    <p>Traditionally covered in chocolate sprinkles, these sweet treats are a must-have 
        at birthday parties and celebrations and are loved by both children and adults.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (395 g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles for rolling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and starts to pull away from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, stir in the vanilla extract if using, and let the mixture cool completely on a greased plate or dish.</li>
        <li>Once cool, grease your hands lightly with butter, scoop small portions of the mixture, and roll them into bite-sized balls.</li>
        <li>Roll each ball in chocolate sprinkles until fully coated and place them in paper candy cups or on a serving plate.</li>
    </ol>
